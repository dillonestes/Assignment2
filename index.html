        <p>Minecraft is an open world game that has no specific goals for the player to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.[20] However, there is an achievement system.[21] Gameplay by default is first person, but players have the option to play in third person mode.[22] The core gameplay revolves around breaking and placing blocks. The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes—arranged in a fixed grid pattern and representing different materials, such as dirt, stone, various ores, water, lava, tree trunks, etc. While players can move freely across the world, objects can only be placed at fixed locations on the grid. Players can gather these material blocks and place them elsewhere, thus allowing for various constructions.[23]</p>
        <p>At the start of the game, the player is placed on the surface of a procedurally generated and virtually infinite game world.[24] The world is divided into biomes ranging from deserts to jungles to snowfields.[25][26] Players can walk across the terrain consisting of plains, mountains, forests, caves, and various water bodies.[24] The in-game time system follows a day and night cycle, with one full cycle lasting 20 real-time minutes. Throughout the course of the game, players encounter various non-player characters known as mobs, including animals, villagers and hostile creatures.[27] Non-hostile animals—such as cows, pigs, and chickens—can be hunted for food and crafting materials, and spawn in the daytime. By contrast, hostile mobs—such as large spiders, skeletons, and zombies—spawn during nighttime or in dark places, such as caves.[24] Some Minecraft-unique creatures have been noted by reviewers, such as the Creeper, an exploding creature that sneaks up on the player; and the Enderman, a creature with the ability to teleport and pick up blocks.[28]</p>
       
       
        <h2 id="survival">
<a id="survival-mode" class="anchor" href="#survival-mode" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Survival Mode</h2>
        <p>In this mode, players have to gather natural resources (such as wood and stone) found in the environment in order to craft certain blocks and items.[24] Depending on the difficulty, monsters spawn in darker areas in a certain radius of the character, requiring the player to build a shelter at night.[24] The mode also features a health bar which is depleted by attacks from monsters, falls, drowning, falling into lava, suffocation, starvation, and other events. Players also have a hunger bar, which must be periodically refilled by eating food in-game, except in "Peaceful" difficulty, in which the hunger bar does not drain. If the hunger bar is depleted, automatic healing will stop and eventually health will deplete. Health replenishes when players have a nearly full hunger bar, and also regenerates regardless of fullness if players play on the easiest difficulty.</p>
        <p>There are a wide variety of items that players can craft in Minecraft.[37] Players can craft armor, which can help mitigate damage from attacks, while weapons such as swords can be crafted to kill enemies and other animals more easily. Players may acquire resources to craft tools, such as weapons, armor, food, and other items. By acquiring better resources, players can craft more effective items. For example, tools such as axes, shovels, or pickaxes, can be used to chop down trees, dig soil, and mine ores, respectively; tools made of iron perform their tasks more quickly than tools made of stone or wood and can be used more heavily before they break. Players may also trade goods with villager mobs through a bartering system involving trading emeralds for different goods.[38] Villagers often trade with emeralds, wheat or other materials.[27][38]</p>
        <p>The game has an inventory system, and players can carry a limited number of items. Upon dying, items in the players' inventories are dropped, and players re-spawn at the current spawn point, which is set by default where players begin the game, but can be reset if players sleep in a bed.[39] Dropped items can be recovered if players can reach them before they despawn. Players may acquire experience points by killing mobs and other players, mining, smelting ores, breeding animals, and cooking food. Experience can then be spent on enchanting tools, armor and weapons.[36] Enchanted items are generally more powerful, last longer, or have other special effects.[36]</p>

          <p>When I play Minecraft my focus is to be creative and do something that I otherwise cannot do. To me, Minecraft is soothing, but can also be a challenge and keep my mind working.</p>
           
            <p>I do not see minecraft as a game with no objectives. To me, its a way to create your own world.</p>
